## ACAGATATA
This is a JavaScript-based generator for the educational board game _ACAGATATA_, created by [Andr√© Eterovic](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3875-4946) and [Charles Morphy D.

### _The role of mutation in evolution_
The main concept here is mutation. The rules (and mechanics) of the game allow us to simulate particular random events that may occur during the copy of a genome, which happens, for instance, when organisms breed. That randomness can lead to modifications in certain subsequences of the DNA and, therefore, resulting in mutations. However, alteration of the genome does not necessarily means that the DNA-mutant offsprings will express different phenotypes; this is another aspect covered by the board game. Not only we generate the "copies" for a specific parental genomic sequence, but we also analyze the resulting phenotypic traits.
